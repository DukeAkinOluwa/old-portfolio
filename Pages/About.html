            <p>As a seasoned professional, I have devoted considerable time and effort to learning and practicing my skills, gaining a wealth of experience in my field. Although I have not yet completed the certification program I am currently enrolled in, I am confident that my skills and knowledge are of the highest quality. <br> In addition to taking non-certified courses, I have also actively participated and excelled in various competitions within my technical community. These experiences further honed my skills and strengthened my commitment to excellence. <br> While I can't display my certificates at the moment, I am proud of my achievements and look forward to sharing them once I receive them. Thank you for your understanding and I would like to continue to contribute my expertise to your project.</p>
